#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. software engeering is about writing instructions for computer, building apps, games and websites that makes our lives easier and solving real world problems through technology.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. The Emergence of Structured Programming (1960s–1970s)- programs were written in a very ad-hoc manner, often with little regard for structure or maintainability. The Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s)- It proposed a linear, sequential development process, where each phase of development (requirement gathering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance) flows downward like a waterfall. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (1990s–2000s)-emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration, and responding to change over rigidly following a plan.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Planning-the project's scope, objectives, and resources are defined. Feasibility Study- involves gathering and analyzing the business and system requirements. Design-the system's architecture, components, interfaces, and data flow are designed based on the requirements gathered earlier. Development-nvolves the actual creation of the software, where developers write the code according to the design specifications. Testing-the software is tested for defects, bugs, and issues. The goal is to ensure the software meets the requirements and functions as expected.. Deployment-Once the software is fully developed and tested, it is deployed to the production environment for use by the end users. Maintenance-After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored, updated, and improved over time. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. Waterfall is suitable for projects with fixed requirements and predictable timelines, while Agile is ideal for projects that require flexibility and continuous iteration. Waterfall is better for large-scale, less dynamic projects where changes are rare, while Agile works best in environments where change is constant, and rapid feedback and adaptation are crucial.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. A software developer is primarily responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the code that makes up the software product.QA Engineers create comprehensive test plans, strategies, and test cases to ensure the software meets the required quality standards.The Project Manager is responsible for defining the project scope, objectives, and timelines.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. It combines multiple tools into one interface to help developers write, test, and debug their code more efficiently, eg; Visual Studio Code (VS Code). A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps developers manage changes to the source code over time. It tracks every modification made to the code, which is especially valuable for teams working on large projects, eg; Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. The challenges software engineers face can be diverse, ranging from technical difficulties like debugging to organizational issues like meeting deadlines. However, these challenges can be mitigated with effective strategies, such as adopting Agile methodologies, using tools like IDEs and version control systems, maintaining clear communication, and continuously learning. By implementing these strategies, engineers can improve their workflow, ensure high-quality code, and contribute to the success of their projects.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions (often referred to as units) of a software application in isolation to ensure they work as expected. Writing unit tests encourages developers to write modular, well-structured, and maintainable code. Integration testing focuses on testing how different modules or components of the software interact with each other. ntegration testing helps catch issues that arise from the interaction between modules, such as mismatched data formats, communication errors, or incorrect data handling. vSystem testing involves testing the complete and integrated software product as a whole. The goal is to ensure that the entire system functions according to the specified requirements, covering both functional and non-functional aspects (e.g., performance, security). System testing ensures that all components work together as intended and that the entire system meets business requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. prompt engineering involves crafting the right questions or instructions to guide the model toward providing the best possible responses for specific tasks. It is a crucial skill in the effective use of AI, particularly in language models that generate text based on input prompts.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. "Tell me about the weather." = "Can you provide the weather forecast for New York City for the next three days, including temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions?"
